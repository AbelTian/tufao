 * SessionStore class can be used to store data that must persist among
 * different requests.
 *
 * The session data is stored in properties. You can create a session to any
 * pair of request and response objects and each one has a independent set of
 * properties.
 *
 * To access the session properties, you must pass request and response objects
 * each time you want to manipulate a property, but this repetitive task can be
 * eliminated using the Session helper class.
 *
 * One session only persists for a specified period of time (set through
 * SessionSettings) and the storage details depends upon the class implementing
 * the SessionStore interface.
 *
 * \note You can configure a session in any response (including 400-level and
 * 500-level status responses), but user agents may ignore sessions in 100-level
 * status.
 *
 * If you intend to provide your own storage backend, implements the pure
 * virtual methods (the protected methods may help you).
