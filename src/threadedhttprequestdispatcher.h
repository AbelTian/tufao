/*!
  This class provides a robust and high performance Threaded HTTP request dispatcher.

  It takes a incoming request and forwards it to one of its internal worker threads.
  The size of the threadpool can be customized. The handleRequest function will
  ALWAYS return true, because there is no way the dispatcher can know if the request
  was handled properly inside one of the threads.

  The dispatcher supports asynchronous programming and will be attached to a request
  until finished() was emitted from the response object, or the connection is closed.

  \warning
  Always call end() on your response object or the thread will be stuck forever with
  the request and the dispatcher will run out of threads.


  The code below provides an example usage:

  \include threadedapplicationdefaultmain.cpp

  \warning
  Do NEVER delete a Factory as long as the threads are running
  If you need to delete it, you have to unregister it from the Router and call reload()
  Only after that call its safe to delete a Factory object
