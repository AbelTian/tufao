/*!
  This class provides a robust and high performance Threaded HTTP request router. It
  allows to register a chain of request handler factories. This router uses mapping rules
  based on the url's path component and http method to determine the correct
  handlers.

  The type of mapping rules used in this class provides a predictable behaviour
  that is simple to understand and allow the use of caching algorithms to
  improve the performance.

  When the router finds one matching request handler, it will call it passing
  the request and response objects. If the found handler cannot handle the
  request (this is indicated by the return value), the router will continue its
  quest in the search of a worthy handler. If the router fails in its quest
  (when no handlers are found or when none of the found handlers are able to
  respond the request), the handleRequest method in the router returns false and
  the connection remains open. This mean that you should always create a handler
  that responds to any request with a <i>404 not found</i> as the last handler
  in the most top-level request router.

  The code below provides an example usage:

  \include applicationdefaultmain.cpp

  \warning
  Do NEVER delete a Factory as long as the threads are running
  If you need to delete it, you have to unregister it from the Router and call reload()
  Only after that call its safe to delete a Factory object
