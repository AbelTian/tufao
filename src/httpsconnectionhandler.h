/*!
  Tufao::HttpsConnectionHandler is a subclass of Tufao::HttpConnectionHandler that provides secure
  communication with the client.

  It does this using socket streams over TLS connections.

  This combination (HTTP + SSL/TLS) is know as HTTP Secure and provides
  encrypted communication.

  To use HTTPS in Tuf√£o, just set the local certficate and private key before
  call Tufao::HttpsServer::listen. The default port for this protocol is 443.

  \note
  You should also pay to a trusted certificate authority to sign your
  certificate if you are willing to provide secure identification also.

  \note
  The use of HTTPS implies an extra overhead in the software, limiting the
  number of requests that can be served per time and should be moderated. It's
  common to use it only in pages that handles more sensitive information, such
  as login pages and payment transactions.
